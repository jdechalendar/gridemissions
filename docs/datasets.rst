Datasets
========
Two types of datasets are made available through this project: 1) live and 2) historical (or “bulk”).

Live
----
The "live" datasets are used to make the maps at `energy.stanford.edu/gridemissions`_ and are also available via the ``api`` module in this package. These currently include two weeks' worth of data. The live datasets are updated on an hourly basis using a cron job that runs script ``src/gridemissions/scripts/update_live_dataset.sh``. That script pulls data from the EIA API and then runs the workflows in this package to process the data.

Bulk
----
The "bulk" datasets correspond to the six-month files made available by the EIA. The datasets can be generated by running ``make bulk``. These datasets are used to make the reports that can be found at `energy.stanford.edu/gridemissions`_ (Heatmaps and Timeseries tabs).

Memo of how I make the datasets and reports publicly available:

1. upload bulk files to the Stanford AWS EC2 instance that has access (e.g., via ``scp processed.tar.gz ge-priv:/data/ec2-user/EIA_Grid_Monitor/.``)
2. ``make bulk_upload`` to upload the dataset to the S3 bucket
3. ``make bulk_report`` to make the automated reports and upload them to S3 bucket
4. Delete uncompressed version of the archive on the EC2 instance to save space
